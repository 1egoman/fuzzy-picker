# Contributing to React Fuzzy Picker

Here's what you need to do to get a local, running version of the codebase:
```
git clone git@github.com:1egoman/fuzzy-picker.git
cd fuzzy-picker
npm install --dev

# to build the example (open localhost:8080 in a browser)
gulp example

# to run tests
npm test
```

Before you open a PR:
- If you're making backwards-incompatible change, make it clear. Refrain from doing so unless
  absolutely necessary.
- Make sure the tests pass by running `npm test`
- Try to follow the coding style of the project. If you have any questions leave an issue.
